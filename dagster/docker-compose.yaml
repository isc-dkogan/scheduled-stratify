services:

  # This service runs the gRPC server that loads your user code, in both dagster-webserver
  # and dagster-daemon. By setting DAGSTER_CURRENT_IMAGE to its own image, we tell the
  # run launcher to use this same image when launching runs in a new container as well.
  # Multiple containers like this can be deployed separately - each just needs to run on
  # its own port, and have its own entry in the workspace.yaml file that's loaded by the
      # webserver.

  # This service runs dagster-webserver, which loads your user code from the user code container.
  # Since our instance uses the QueuedRunCoordinator, any runs submitted from the webserver will be put on
  # a queue and later dequeued and launched by dagster-daemon.
